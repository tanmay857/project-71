		<h4>Pulse-2021</h4>
		
			<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Bal Bharati Public School, GRH Marg persistently strives to provide a legion of learning opportunities to the students. We believe that in addition to the standard framework of educational curriculum, there are endless opportunities for students to learn new skills and ignite new passions by participating in co-curricular activities. PULSE offers this opportunity to them each year by building on their collaborative and social skills and exposing them to a gamut of new and enriching experiences.

PULSE 2021 is special for us as the activities are a coalescence of Indian arts, crafts and culture. Our aim is to celebrate the diversity and richness of our culture and heritage. We hope this event will create broader perspectives and provide real world skills to all the participants. At a time when our spirits have been ravaged by a raging pandemic, we hope this event will provide the much needed shift and happiness to the young learners.</p>
